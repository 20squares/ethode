## setup

1. You will need `python3.10` or newer; see if it is installed on your
   system by executing in a terminal `python3 --version`.

1. I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage
   your python versions, or you can just [download python
   here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and use a [virtual
   environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to keep
   stuff separated.

1. Install packages `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

1. Profit.
