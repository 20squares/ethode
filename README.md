# ethode

## Setup

## Recommended
1. Install the [`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. Read through `examples.py`, referencing `ethode.py` to see how things are done.
3. Use `uv run` to run things, all the package management and the Python version management are taken care of automatically.
4.  ...
5.  Profit.

## Without `uv`
1. You will need `python3.10` or newer; see if it is installed on your
   system by executing in a terminal `python3 --version`.

1. I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage your python versions, or you can just [download python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to keep stuff separated.
2. Install packages `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Read through `examples.py`, referencing `ethode.py` to see how things are done
